A comprehensive school-management website to facilitate day-to-day school operations efficiently. It contains all the features a school may require such as an attendance tracker, homework, discussion posts, timetable, tests, exams, and even the ability to manage Zoom links for conducting classes online. I was inspired to create this project as a solution to the restrictions posed by the COVID-19 pandemic on schools.
